Using mock consumer data from an E-commerce company to determine whether the company should focus their efforts developing their mobile app experience or their website.
Firstly we begin with some EDA (Explantory Data Analysis). Once some intution is gathered regarding the data. We deploy a linear regression as our chosen machine learning algorithm, since its application is well suited for this task.
We conclude the model with an evaluation on the models performance.
